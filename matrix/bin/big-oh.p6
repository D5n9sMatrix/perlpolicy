 Big-Oh Notation/Perspective
 In certain settings it is handy to use the "Big-Oh" notation when an order-of-magnitude
 assessment of work suffices. (We did this in § 1 . 1 . 1 . ) Dot products are O(n), matrix­
 vector products are O(n2 ) , and matrix-matrix products arc O(n3 ) . Thus, to make
 efficient an algorithm that involves a mix of these operations, the focus should typically
 be on the highest order operations that are involved as they tend to dominate the overall
 computation.

=head1 DESCRIPTION
1 . 1 . 17
The Notion of 11Level" and the B LAS
The dot product and sappy operations are examples of level-1 operations. Level-I
operations involve an amount of data and an amount of arithmetic that are linear in
the dimension of the operation. An m-by-n outer product update or a galaxy operation
involves a quadratic amount of data ( 0( mn)) and a quadratic amount of work ( 0( mn)) .
These are level-2 operations. The matrix multiplication update C = C +AB is a level-3
operation. Level-3 operations are quadratic in data and cubic in work.
Important level-1 , level-2, and level-3 operations are encapsulated in the "BLAS, ''
an acronym that stands for H_asic Linear Algebra .Subprograms. See LAPACK. The design
of matrix algorithms that are rich in level-3 BLAS operations is a major preoccupation
of the field for reasons that have to do with data reuse (§1.5).

Verifying a Matrix Equation
In striving to understand matrix multiplication via outer products, we essentially es­
established the matrix equation
AB=
bk
Lab[,
k= l
r
( 1 . 1 .4)
where the ak and are defined by the partitions in ( 1 . 1 .3).
Numerous matrix equations are developed in subsequent chapters. Sometimes
they are established algorithmically as above and other times they are proved at the
ij-component level, e.g. ,
lt,••brL t, [••bIL; t, b,;

�
.. .
�
[ABlw
Scalar-level verifications such as this usually provide little insight. However, they are
sometimes the only way to proceed.

Complex Matrices
On occasion we shall he concerned with computations that involve complex matrices.
The vector space of m-by-n complex matrices is designated by <Cm x n . The scaling,
addition, and multiplication of complex matrices correspond exactly to the real case.
However, transposition becomes conjugate transposition:
Cij = llj i·
The vector space of complex n-vectors is designated by <Cn . The dot product of complex
c =AH
n-vectors x and y is prescribed by
::
n
s = xHy = L XiYi ·
i= l
<Cm x n , then we designate the real and imaginary parts of A by Re( A) =
Band lm(A) = C, respectively. The conjugate of A is the matrix A = (aij ) ·
If A = B + iC E
Problems
P l . 1 . 1 Suppose A E Rn x n and x E R r arc given. Give an algorithm for computing the first column
of M = (A - :r.11} · · · (A Xrl ) .
P l . 1 . 2 In a conventional 2-by-2 matrix multiplication C = AB, there are eight multiplications: a11 bu,
aub12, a21bu, a21b12, ai2b21, a12�2. a22b21, and a22b22. Make a table that indicates the order that
these multiplications are performed for the ijk, jik, kij , ikj , jki, and kji matrix multiplication
algorithms.
P l . 1 . 3 Give an O(n 2 ) algorithm for computing C = (xyT)k where x and y are n-vectors.
P l . 1 . 4 Suppose D = ABC where A E Rm x n , B E
and C E w x q . Compare the flop count of
an algorithm that computes D via the formula D = (AB)C versus the flop count for an algorithm that
computes D using D = A(BC) . Under what conditions is the former procedure more flop-efficient
than the latter?
Pl . 1.5 Suppose we have real n-by-n matrices C, D, E, and F. Show how to compute real n-by-n
matrices A and B with just three real n-by-n matrix multiplications so that
A + iB = (C + i D ) (E + i F ) .

Band Matrices
A matrix is sparse if a large fraction of its entries are zero. An important special case
is the band matrix. We say that A E nrn x n has lower bandwidth p if a ii = 0 whenever
i > j + p and upper bandwidth q if j > i + q implies aii = 0. Here is an example of an
8-by-5 matrix that has lower bandwidth 1 and upper bandwidth 2:

0 x x x x
0 0 x x x
A
0 0 0 x x
0 0 0 0 x
0 0 0 0 0
0 0 0 0 0
The x ' s designate arbitrary nonzero entries. This notation is handy to indicate the
structure of a matrix and we use it extensively. Band structures that occur frequently
are tabulated in Table 1.2 . 1.
