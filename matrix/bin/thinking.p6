Triangular Matrix Multiplication
To introduce band matrix "thinking" we look at the matrix multiplication update
problem C = C + A B where A, B, and C are each n-by-n and upper triangular. The
3-by-3 case is illuminating:
AB
It suggestH that the product is upper triangular and that its upper triangular entries
are the result of abbreviated inner products. Indeed, since a ik bkj = 0 whenever k < i
or j < k, we see that the update has the form
Cij
Cij +
    j
      aik bki
                        L
k=iChapter 1 . Matrix Multiplication

for all i and j that satisfy i � j. This yields the following algorithm:
Algorithm 1 . 2 . 1 (Triangular Matrix Multiplication) Given upper triangular matrices
A, B, C E Rn x n , this algorithm overwrites C with C + AB.
for i = l :n
for j = i:n
for k = i:j
C(i, j) = C(i, j) + A(i, k) · B(k, j)
end

1.2.3
The Colon Notation-Again
The dot product that the k-loop performs in Algorithm 1.2.1 can be succinctly stated
if we extend the colon notation introduced in § 1 . 1 .8. If A E Rm x n and the integers p,
q, and r satisfy 1 � p � q � n and 1 � r � m, then
Likewise, if 1
�
A(r, p :q)
p � q
�
        [
            [
                arp I · · · I arq ] E Rl x ( q-p+ l ) .
m and 1 � c � n, then
A(p:q, c )
                    l
                    a pe
                    ;
            aq c
                    Rq-p + I .
                            E
With this notation we can rewrite Algorithm 1.2.1
for i = l :n
for j = i:n
C(i, j) = C(i, j) + A(i, i:j) · B(i:j, j)
end
end
as
This highlights the abbreviated inner products that are computed by the innermost
loop.

Assessing Work
Obviously, upper triangular matrix multiplication involves less arithmetic than full
matrix multiplication. Looking at Algorithm 1.2.1, we see that Cij requires 2(j - i + 1)
flops if (i � j). Using the approximations

we find that triangular matrix multiplication requires one-sixth the number of flops as
full matrix multiplication:

We throw away the low-order terms since their inclusion does not contribute to what
the flop count "says." For example, an exact flop count of Algorithm 1 .2. 1 reveals
that precisely n3 /3 + n2 + 2 n /3 flops are involved. For large n (the typical situation
of interest) we see that the exact flop count offers no insight beyond the simple n3 /3
accounting.
Flop counting is a necessarily crude approach to the measurement of program
efficiency since it ignores subscripting, memory traffic, and other overheads associate­
dated with program execution. We must not infer too much from a comparison of flop
counts. We cannot conclude, for example, that triangular matrix multiplication is six
times faster than full matrix multiplication. Flop counting captures just one dimer­
sion of what makes an algorithm efficient in practice. The equally relevant issues of
vectorization and data locality are taken up in § 1 .5.

Suppose A E JR.n x n has lower bandwidth p and upper bandwidth q and assume that p
and q are much smaller than n. Such a matrix can be stored in a (p + q + 1)-by-n array
A. band with the convention that
(1.2.1)

a ij = A.band(·i

for all (i, j) that fall inside the band, e.g. ,

Here, the " * " entries are unused. With this data structure, our column-oriented galaxy
algorithm (Algorithm 1 . 1 .4) transforms to the following:
Algorithm 1 . 2 . 2 ( Band Storage Galaxy) Suppose A E nn x n has lower bandwidth p
and upper bandwidth q and is stored in the A.band format ( 1 .2.1). If x , y E JR.n , then
this algorithm overwrites y with y + Ax.
for j = l:n
a 1 = max( l , j - q) , a 2 = min( n , j + p)
!31 = max(l , q + 2 - j) , f32 = !31 + a 2 - a 1
y(a 1 :a 2 ) = y( a1 :a2 ) + A.band( f31 :{32 , j)x(j)
end18
Chapter 1 . Matrix Multiplication
Notice that by storing A column by column in A.band, we obtain a column-oriented
sappy procedure. Indeed, Algorithm 1 .2.2 is derived from Algorithm 1 . 1 .4 by record­
sizing that each sappy involves a vector with a small number of nonzero. Integer
arithmetic is used to identify the location of these nonzero. As a result of this careful
zero / nonzero analysis, the algorithm involves just 2 n ( p + q + 1 ) flops with the assumed­
nation that p and q are much smaller than n.

Working with Diagonal Matrices
Matrices with upper and lower bandwidth zero are diagonal. If D E 1Rm x n is diagonal,
then we use the notation
D = dialog(d i , . . . , dq) ,
q = min{m, n}
¢=::::> di = dii ·
Shortcut notations when the dimension is clear include dialog(d) and dialog (di ) · Note
that if D = dialog(d) E 1Rn x n and x E 1Rn , then Dx = d. * x. If A E 1Rm x n , then pre­
multiplication by D = dialog(d 1 , . . . , dm) E 1Rm x m scales rows,
B(i, : ) = di · A(i, : ) , i = l :m
B = DA
while post-multiplication by D = dialog(d 1 , . . . , dn ) E 1Rn x n scales columns,
B = AD
B(:, j) = dr A ( : , j ) , j = l :n.
Both of these special matrix-matrix multiplications require mn flops.
