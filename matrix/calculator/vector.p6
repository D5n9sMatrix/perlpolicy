Specifying Integer Vectors and Matrices
For permutation matrix work and block matrix manipulation (§1 .3) it is convenient to
have a method for specifying structured integer vectors of subscripts. The MATLAB
colon notation is again the proper vehicle and a few examples suffice to show how it
works. If n = 8, then
v = 1:2:n
v = n: -1 : 1
v = [ ( 1 :2:n) (2:2:n) ]
}
}
}
v = [ 1 3 5 7] ,
v = [ s 1 6 5 4 3 2 1 J,
v = [ 1 3 5 7 2 4 6 8 J.Chapter

Matrix Multiplication
Suppose A E Rm x n and that v E R'. and w E R8 are integer vectors with the
property that 1 ;; Vi � m and 1 � Wi � n. If B = A(v, w) , then B E w x s is

Working with Permutation Matrices
Using the colon notation, the 4-by-4 permutation matrix in ( 1.2.3) is defined by P =
I4 (v, :) where v = [ 2 4 3 l ] . In general, if v E Rn is a permutation of the vector
l :n = [1 , 2, . . . , n] and P = In (v, : ) , then
y = Px
y = pTx
y = x ( v)
y(v) = x
Yi = Xv; i i = l :n
Yv; = Xi, i = l:n
The second result follows from the fact that Vi is the row index of the "l" in column i
of pT_ Note that PT(Px) = x. The inverse of a permutation matrix is its transpose.
The action of a permutation matrix on a given matrix A E Rm x n is easily de­
scribed. If P = Im (v, : ) and Q = In (w, : ), then PYQT = A(v, w). It also follows that
In (v, : ) In (w, : ) = In (w(v), : ) . Although permutation operations involve no fl.ops, they
move data and contribute to execution time, an issue that is discussed in § 1 .5.

The downshift permutation 'Dn pushes the components of a vector down one notch

In general, if v = [ (2:n) 1 ] , then the n-by-n downshift permutation is given by 'Dn =
In (v, : ) . Note that V'f:. can be regarded as an shift permutation.
The mod-p perfect shuffle permutation 'Pp , r treats the components of the input
